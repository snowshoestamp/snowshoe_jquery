Snowshoe jQuery
============
Front-end client to submit Snowshoe stamp point data to your backend.

## Current Version
- 0.3.2

## Dependencies
- jQuery (>= 1.8.x)

## Usage
### Stamp screen
At the bottom of any page you want to make "stampable", create an object with initialization data and include the Snowshoe jQuery module. ``$.snowshoe`` will construct the necessary touch event listener and client to submit stamp data to your backend.

```javascript
<script>
  var stampScreenInitData = {
    "postUrl": "http://mydomain.com/stampscreen",
    // element id of what you want to be stampable
    // this can be on a canvas, div or the body
    "stampScreenElmId": "stamp-screen"
  }
</script>
<script src="jquery.snowshoe.js"></script>
```

Optionally, post via AJAX and handle success/failure/complete in the client.

**_NOTE:_** Whenever stamp data is submitted by Ajax, it waits for request completion before generating another Ajax request.

```javascript
<script>
var stampScreenInitData = {
  "postUrl": "http://mydomain.com/stampscreen",
  "stampScreenElmId": "stamp-screen",
  "postViaAjax": true, // post via Ajax  
  "success": function(response){
    // handle success
    console.log("Success!");
  },
  "error": function(response){
    // handle failure
    console.log(" :-( ");
  },
  "complete": function(response){
    // Do something on complete
    console.log(" All Done ");
  }
}
</script>
<script src="jquery.snowshoe.js"></script>
```

### Progress Bar Animation
This module comes with the ability to trigger a loading animation as soon as a stamp is touched to the screen.  To use this feature,

1\. Include `snowshoe-sample.css`.  The loading animation is CSS-based and optimized for quick load times.

```html
<!-- Snowshoe loader CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="snowshoe-sample.css">

```

2\. Create a div with the id of `#snowshoe-progress-bar`.

```html
<!-- Snowshoe loader -->
<div id="snowshoe-progress-bar"></div>
```

3\. Add the `progressBarOn` key to the initialization data object at the bottom of the page and set its value to `true`.  The plugin will now handle the load animation by dynamically adding the class `.snowshoe-progress-bar` to the element that wears the id `#snowshoe-progress-bar`.

```javascript
<script>
var stampScreenInitData = {
  "postUrl": "http://mydomain.com/stampscreen",
  "stampScreenElmId": "stamp-screen",
  "progressBarOn": true,
  "postViaAjax": true, // post via Ajax  
  "success": function(response){
    // handle success
    console.log("Success!");
  },
  "error": function(response){
    // handle failure
    console.log(" :-( ");
  },
  "complete": function(response){
    // handle complete
    console.log(" All Done ");
	// clear animation
    $('#snowshoe-progress-bar').removeClass("snowshoe-progress-bar");
  }
}
</script>
<script src="jquery.snowshoe.js"></script>
```

The Snowshoe jQuery module dynamically adds the load animation class whenever 5 simultaneous touch events occur (i.e. a user touches a stamp to a screen).

Feel free to override any of the CSS with your own. Also, if youâ€™d like to implement your own loader, simply remove the `progressBarOn` key from your initialization data object or set it to `false`.

**_NOTE:_** When submitting stamp data via a normal HTTP POST, and redirecting to another page upon a successful stamp interaction, you will want to ensure that the progress bar animation is removed if a user returns to the stamp screen using the browser's _back_ button. To ensure compatibility on the largest number of mobile browsers, we suggest adding the following code below your `jquery.snowshoe.js` reference.

```javascript
<script>
  window.onpopstate=function(){
    $('#snowshoe-progress-bar').removeClass("snowshoe-progress-bar");
  };
</script>
```   

### Help Messages
If a user is having trouble with their stamp, displaying help messages to them can be useful. With our new Stamp 2.0 hardware, it helps to stamp and hold for a couple seconds on some devices. We've added dynamic messaging to this module allowing you to display custom messaging onscreen that will guide users toward best stamping practices.

1\. Include `snowshoe-sample.css`.  This includes default styling to display the messages. Feel free (and you should) customize this css as needed.

```html
<!-- Snowshoe messages CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="snowshoe-sample.css">

```

2\. Create a div with the id of `#snowshoe-messages`.

```html
<!-- Snowshoe messages -->
<div id="snowshoe-messages"></div>
```

3\. To add helpful messaging for when a user isn't touching the stamp to the screen fully, insert an html block in the initialization data in the format referenced below. First, a user will see a `userTraining` message for 2 seconds (instructs them to hold the stamp on the screen), followed by an `insufficientPoints` message (informs them to lift the stamp and try again). We used `<h3>` tags in the example but feel free to use any html you would like. It will be dynamically appended to the `<div>` with the id of `#snowshoe-messages`.

```javascript
<script>
var stampScreenInitData = {
  "postUrl": "http://mydomain.com/stampscreen",
  "stampScreenElmId": "stamp-screen",
  "progressBarOn": true,
  "messages": {
    "userTraining" : "<h3>Keep holding</h3>",
    "insufficientPoints" : "<h3>Try again!</h3>"
  }
}
</script>
<script src="jquery.snowshoe.js"></script>
```

4\. If you are using ajax to send stamp data to your backend, you can likewise append a helpful error messaging html block in the error callback to let your users know that a stamp wasn't recognized.

```javascript
<script>
var stampScreenInitData = {
  "postUrl": "http://mydomain.com/stampscreen",
  "stampScreenElmId": "stamp-screen",
  "progressBarOn": true,
  "messages": {
    "userTraining" : "<h3>Keep holding</h3>",
    "insufficientPoints" : "<h3>Try again!</h3>"
  },
  "postViaAjax": true,
  "success": function(response){
    // handle success
    console.log("Success!");
    // clear screen
    $('#snowshoe-progress-bar').removeClass("snowshoe-progress-bar");
    $("#snowshoe-messages").empty();
  },
  "error": function(response){
    // handle failure
    console.log(" :-( ");
    // clear screen
    $('#snowshoe-progress-bar').removeClass("snowshoe-progress-bar");
    $("#snowshoe-messages").empty();
    // show failure message
    $("#snowshoe-messages").append("<h3>That stamp was not found. Please try again!</h3>");
  }
}
</script>
<script src="jquery.snowshoe.js"></script>
```

Again, feel free to override any of snowshoe-sample.css with your own, just be sure to keep the element id `#snowshoe-messages` on the div you want to append your help message html blocks to.
